TITLE:    The Weight

ARTIST:  Geneva Lee Robles

MEDIUM: This work is an image composition with generative elements. The underlying image is a handmade linocut print whose parts were deconstructed via powerpoint, and pixel arrays processed via p5js. In this debut collection, the artist utilizes traditional and digital mediums to convey the feeling of simplicity and chaos.           

THE ART: “The Weight” is an award winner for the New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) NFT Award Program.  Inspired by bridging traditional art and technology, subsequent iterations of the work utilize coded generative elements to enhance its story.  

EXHIBITION: “THE WEIGHT” is a part of “Demystifying NFTs: The Award Exhibition”, on display in Voxel’s Metaverse at the BRIDGE ++ space from December 15th - December 31st, 2022, curated by Laura Ó Reilly and presented by NYFA. 

BEHIND THE ART: Weight is a recurring theme in the artist’s work, depicted metaphorically as she revisits the emotional turbulence she experienced as a child of Chinese and Puerto Rican descent, raised in a home of heroin addiction and chaos. The weight tells the story of the heaviness we carry in life, and our resilience to keep going in spite of its persistence.  

ABOUT THE ARTIST:  Geneva Lee Robles is an interdisciplinary artist, living in New York City.  She was born in the Bronx and raised in Brooklyn, NY, during a tumultuous period in the 1980s.  Her work attempts to capture the emotional turbulence one is feeling, when no one is watching. She explores themes of loneliness within oneself and their relationships.  She is inspired by integrating traditional forms of art and pushing the envelope of what's possible through technology.
